## ✨ Overview
This repository contains my personal portfolio site, created as part of the course requirement for **CC 206 – Application Development and Emerging Technologies**. It highlights my education, selected projects, technical skills, and ways to connect with me. The site emphasizes:

- Clean and semantic HTML structure
- Accessible navigation and reduced‑motion respect
- Responsive CSS layout with custom design tokens
- Light / dark theme toggle with user preference persistence
- Progressive enhancement using vanilla JavaScript (no heavy frameworks)

## 🚀 Features
- Sticky, accessible navigation with mobile slide‑in menu
- Dynamic skill cards loaded from `skills.json`
- Light / dark mode (auto-detects OS preference + saves choice)
- Smooth section scroll & intersection-based reveal animations
- Responsive grid layouts for projects and skills
- Contact form front‑end validation mock (no backend required)
- Semantic landmarks (`header`, `main`, `section`, `nav`, `figure`, `footer`)
- Lazy-loaded profile image & performant asset usage
- Minimal external dependencies (Google Fonts + Font Awesome)
